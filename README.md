# 6-Degree-of-Freedom-robotic-arm-using-Arduino
Designed and implemented a **6-DOF robotic arm** for low-cost pick-and-place automation using **Arduino Uno**. The system uses a hybrid servo setup (**MG996R + SG90**) with PWM-based control and a GUI interface, delivering smooth multi-axis motion and hands-on experience in **embedded systems and robotics**.
